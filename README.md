# Finance Feather

Finance Feather was created as part of the 4HC3 course at McMaster University. A term-long project to iteratively design and evaluate an interactive, user-centric interface. The final report document in this repo is a compilation of 5 different milestones and includes stakeholder analysis, ideation, the low-fidelity design and user-testing, and finally the high-fidelity product.

The final prototype is [hosted on Vercel](https://financefeather-farzany.vercel.app/auth/signin). Feel free to register for an account to play around with the prototype. This entire website was created in 4 days, so a lot of the data on the dashboard is mocked and identical for all users. However, the Financial Goals feature works as expected - as it was a focus of the project.
